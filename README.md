Visitors can also login by signing up and create their own user profile.

After logging in, visitors arrive at their feed where they can view activities created by users that they follow. If a visitor is not currently following other users, they will be prompted to follow another user before they can view any activities in their feed.

After clicking the button to "Find Friends" or by searching for friends using the search bar, visitors will be presented with a list of users that they can follow.

Returning to their feed, visitors will then be able to see activities in the "Following" Tab and the "My Activities" tab ordered by activity date. The "Following" tab includes activities created by the visitor and users that they follow. The "My Activities" tab includes activities created only by the user. For each activity, visitors will: be able to see the number of likes (displayed as kudos) and comments an activity has, have the option to like/unlike the activity if they are not the owner, and have the ability to open a modal to see comment and kudos details.

While viewing the comments modal, visitors will: have the ability to post/edit/ or delete comments they are the owner of, have the ability to delete any comment if they are the owner of the activity, and view details for users that have liked the activity.

To create an activity, visitors can access the dropdown in the top right corner of the window to either manually create an activity or to record an activity.

For manually creating an activity, visitors will will be required to submit data for distance, duration, title, sport, and date of the activity.

For recording activities, this applicates integrates into react a running tracker developed by [Anthony Ng](https://medium.com/@engineerng) that he shared in the article: [Make a running tracker with Geolocation API](https://medium.com/geekculture/make-a-running-tracker-with-geolocation-api-8b2ac541196e). Recording an activity using this feature allows the visitor to toggle on/off a tracker that tracks the distance, duration, and elevation gain of an activity. When recording is toggled off, visitors can then choose to save the activity with the recorded data along with a map including a polyline displaying the visitor's path during the activity.

The final feature included in FootTracks is the "My Activities" page where visitors have the option to edit/delete any of their owned activities.

# Future Implementation Goals

Features that are planned to be built into FootTracks at a later date include a user profile page, the ability for users to create/read/delete images to their activities, an activity details page, and the implementation of a groups feature that users can join and interact with activities from other members of the group.
